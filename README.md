# For contributors
First of all, download Unity Hub and download **EXACTLY the <ins>6000.3.4f1** version of engine. Make sure you enabled "Windows Build Support (Mono)" module before downloading the rest of engine, to not lose the time.
![Engine Version](gitimages/engines.png)

After you done, follow the next instructions:

1. Clone the repository:
~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/MiraDiv-git/winterschool2026
~~~

2. Open Unity Hub, register or log in in a prefered way
3. Press at "Add" button and select "Add project from disk" in the dropdown:
![Add project](gitimages/addpr.png)
4. In the selection windows select the directory where you cloned repository
5. Enter the project
> [!NOTE]
First launch may take a while, as Unity should download basic libraries. That's why project's repository looks 'that small'. Trust me there's everything you need
