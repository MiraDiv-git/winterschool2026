After you done, follow the next instructions:

1. Clone the repository:
~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/MiraDiv-git/winterschool2026
~~~

2. Open Unity Hub, register or log in in a prefered way

4. In the selection windows select the directory where you cloned repository
5. Enter the project
> [!NOTE]
First launch may take a while, as Unity should download basic libraries. That's why project's repository looks 'that small'. Trust me there's everything you need
